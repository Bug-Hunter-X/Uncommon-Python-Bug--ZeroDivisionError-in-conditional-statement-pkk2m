This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Python, where a `ZeroDivisionError` occurs only under certain conditions. The error is triggered when the function attempts to divide by zero, but this only happens when the input `x` is equal to zero.  The solution showcases how to handle this specific case, providing robustness to prevent unexpected crashes. The core learning point is to carefully consider the edge cases and input validation in your Python functions to avoid such errors.
